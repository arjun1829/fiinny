## 1️⃣ PROBLEM BUSINESS REQUIREMENT (PBR)

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Credit cards have become **one of the biggest silent financial traps** in India.

Key realities:

* Users hold **multiple credit cards** across banks
* Spend without realizing **billing cycles, due dates, and interest impact**
* Pay only **Minimum Due**, leading to **compounding interest**
* Miss payments → **late fees + credit score damage**
* Don’t understand:

  * How interest is calculated
  * Which card to use for what spend
  * When to convert to EMI or close a card
* Rewards, cashback, and offers are **under-utilized or misused**
* Credit limit misuse leads to **poor credit utilization ratio**

**Result:**
Users *think* credit cards are helping cash flow, but they actually:

* Lose money
* Damage credit score
* Get stuck in revolving debt cycles

---

### 1.2 Who Faces This Problem?

**Primary Personas (India-focused):**

1. Young professionals (22–35)

   * 2–5 credit cards
   * Salary-based lifestyle inflation
2. Middle-income families

   * High EMI + credit card overlap
3. Freelancers / self-employed

   * Irregular income
   * Revolving credit dependence
4. Cashback / rewards chasers

   * Spend-driven misuse
5. Financially unaware users

   * Don’t understand APR, utilization, billing cycles

### 1.3 Why Existing Solutions Fail

| Existing Option         | Why It Fails                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bank apps               | Single-card view only         |
| Excel / manual tracking | Too complex & error-prone     |
| Generic finance apps    | No India-specific card logic  |
| Credit score apps       | Only show score, not behavior |
| SMS alerts              | Reactive, not preventive      |

---

### 1.4 Business Opportunity

If users manage **credit cards better**, they:

* Save interest
* Improve credit score
* Become eligible for better loans
* Trust the platform deeply

👉 Credit Card Module becomes a **gateway to full financial control**, upsell, and long-term retention.

## 2️⃣ CURRENT STATE (AS-IS)

### 2.1 User Behavior Today

* Uses cards blindly
* Remembers due dates manually
* Pays minimum due frequently
* Converts purchases to EMI without impact clarity
* Uses wrong card for wrong category
* Discovers fees **after statement generation**
