# Expenses Screen

The primary "Expenses" tab in the main navigation.

## Overview

`ExpensesScreen` provides a high-level overview of spending behavior. It combines mini pie charts with a list of recent transactions. It emphasizes time-based navigation (Day, Week, Month) and categorization.

## Key Differences from Transactions Screen

- **Visualization**: Includes `PieChart` sections for quick category breakdowns.
- **Date Navigation**: Focuses on "Period" (e.g., "This Month", "Last Month") rather than complex arbitrary ranges.
- **Search**: Implements a local search filter (`_searchQuery`) along with chip-based filtering for Merchants and Banks.

## Components

- **Charts**: Uses `fl_chart` to render mini visuals for Income vs Expense.
- **Filters**: "Quick chips" for filtering by specific Bank, Merchant, or Friend.
- **Date Picker**: A bottom sheet for selecting standard accounting periods.
