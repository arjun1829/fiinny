# Bulk Split Screen

A utility for retroactive splitting of multiple items.

## Overview

This screen allows users to take a list of expenses and assign them to a Friend or Group in one go.

## Component Usage

- **PeopleSelectorStep**: Reuses this shared widget (also used in Onboarding) to handle the complexity of picking Friends/Groups and creating new ones inline.

## Flow

1.  Receives a list of `expenses`.
2.  User selects Payer (defaults to self).
3.  User selects Friends OR a Group.
4.  Returns a `BulkSplitResult` to the caller for processing.

## Props

<PropsTable props={[
  {
    name: 'userPhone',
    type: 'String',
    required: true,
    description: 'User ID.'
  },
  {
    name: 'expenses',
    type: 'List<ExpenseItem>',
    required: true,
    description: 'The items to be split.'
  }
]} />
