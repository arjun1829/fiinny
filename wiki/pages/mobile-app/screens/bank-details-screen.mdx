# Bank Details Screen

Also known as "My Wallet".

## Overview

Provides a "Bank Account" centric view of finances. The top half is a carousel of bank cards (`BankCardsCarousel`), and the bottom half is a transaction list filtered by the selected bank.

## Features

- **Bank Carousel**: Visually distinct cards for each bank account (HDFC vs SBI etc.). 
- **Filtering**: Tapping a card filters the `UnifiedTransactionList` to show only transactions issued by that specific bank slug.
- **Deep Integration**: Allows editing transactions directly from this filtered view.
