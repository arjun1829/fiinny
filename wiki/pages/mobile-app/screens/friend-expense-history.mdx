# Friend Expense History Screen

A dedicated, highly visual timeline of shared expenses.

## Overview

While `FriendDetailScreen` has an activity tab, this screen offers a more immersive, full-screen history view with specific aesthetic choices.

## Design

- **Tiffany Blue / Mint Palette**: Uses custom colors (`#81e6d9`, `#b9f5d8`) distinct from the main app theme.
- **Glass Cards**: Expenses are rendered in `_GlassExpenseCard` containers.

## Features

- **Settle Action**: Each expense has an inline "Settle Up" button if not yet settled.
- **Settled State**: Displays a "Settled" chip if the transaction is closed.
