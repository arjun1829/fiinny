# Loans Screen

A dedicated management dashboard for Liabilities.

## Overview

Tracks active and closed loans with a strong focus on EMI and due dates. It separates "Active" and "Closed" loans into segments.

## Design

- **Hero Header**: A large, dark teal (`#09857a`) banner with a rotating financial quote.
- **Glass Summary**: A translucent card summarizing Total Outstanding, Total EMI, and Debt-Free progress.
- **Loan Tiles**: Cards displaying next due date, "Overdue" badges, and EMI details.

## Logic

- **Smart Due Date**: `_nextPaymentDate` calculates the next occurrence of the "Payment Day of Month" (e.g., the 5th) relative to today.
- **Sorting**: loans are sorted by urgency (nearest due date first).
- **Progress**: Visualizes "Years Left" and "Paid %" based on original vs. outstanding amounts.
