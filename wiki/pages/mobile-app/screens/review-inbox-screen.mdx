# Review Inbox Screen

The interface for managing incoming transaction drafts.

## Overview

When the app ingests SMS or Gmail notifications, they are stored as "Drafts" (not committed transactions). This screen allows the user to review, edit, and approve these drafts.

## Features

- **Ingest Drafts**: Reads from `ReviewQueueService`.
- **Bulk Actions**: Supports multi-select to approve many drafts at once.
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by "Needs Amount" (drafts missing critical data), "Debit", or "Credit".
- **Draft Editor**: Tapping an item opens `ReviewDraftEditorSheet` for standardizing data before approval.
- **Dismissible**: Swipe to approve items directly.

## Design

- **Glassmorphism**: Heavy use of backdrop filters and semi-transparent gradients (`_glass` helper).
- **Interactive**: Haptic feedback on selection.
