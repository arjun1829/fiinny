# Bills Overview Screen

A unified calendar of upcoming financial obligations.

## Overview

Aggregates both manual bills (`BillModel`) and credit card dues (`CreditCardModel`) into a single, chronological list. Its primary goal is to provide a "Pay Now" checklist.

## Features

- **Unified List**: Merges distinct data sources (Bills + Cards).
- **Time Sorting**: Auto-sorts by nearest due date.
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded (Green for Paid, Orange/Blue for Due).
- **Quick Action**: "Mark Paid" button directly on the tile.

## Architecture

- **Data Fetching**: Parallel fetches from `BillService` and `CreditCardService`.
- **Polymorphic UI**: Custom list widgets (`_BillEntry` and `_CardBillEntry`) adapt to different model types.

## Props

<PropsTable props={[
  {
    name: 'userId',
    type: 'String',
    required: true,
    description: 'The user ID.'
  }
]} />
