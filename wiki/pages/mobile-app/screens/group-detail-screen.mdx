# Group Detail Screen

The central hub for group management and activity.

## Overview

Canonical view for a Group, located in `lib/details/`. It manages members, balances, and shared expenses in a focused environment.

## Features

- **Member Management**: Fetches and aggregates member profiles (`FriendModel`), handling fuzzy name matching if local contacts are missing.
- **Smart Balances**: Calculates "Who owes who" using `gbm.computeSplits` and displays a simplified "You owe / Owed to you" summary.
- **Interactive Attachments**: Specialized `_attachmentView` that detects images for inline zoomable previews vs generic files for external download.
- **Expenses**: Infinite list of group-specific expenses with edit/delete capabilities that propagate across all members.

## Architecture

- **Data**: Streams `GroupModel` and member details.
- **Logic**: Uses `GroupBalanceMath` for client-side ledger calculations.
- **Location**: Defined in `lib/details/group_detail_screen.dart`.
