# Profile Screen

The user's identity and preference management hub.

## Overview

Allows users to manage their personal details, app preferences, privacy settings, and account lifecycle. It uses a "Card & Expansion Tile" UI pattern to organize complex settings without clutter.

## Features

- **Identity Management**: Edit Name, Email, Phone, and Avatar (Upload or Preset).
- **Privacy Controls**: Toggles for Analytics, Personalized Tips, and Android SMS Permissions.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Options to "Export Data" (BackupService) or "Delete Account".
- **Navigation**: Deep links to Notification Preferences.
- **Completeness Score**: Calculates a profile completeness percentage.

## Architecture

- **Firebase**: Direct integration with `FirebaseAuth` (User mgmt), `Firestore` (User profile doc), and `FirebaseStorage` (Avatar upload).
- **UI Structure**: Uses `_GlassCard` and `ExpansionTile` for a clean, organized layout.

## Props

None (Self-contained, relies on Auth context).
