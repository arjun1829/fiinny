# Settle Up Screen

The settlement command center for a group.

## Overview

Calculates and displays exactly who owes whom within a group. It simplifies complex debts into a list of bilateral settlement actions.

## Logic

- **Balance Calculation**: Client-side logic (`_calculateBalances`) iterates through all group expenses to determine net standing for each member.
- **Bilateral Display**: Shows a list of cards, e.g., "Alice owes You ₹500" or "You owe Bob ₹200".

## Features

- **Settle All**: Bulk action to record settlements for *all* outstanding balances at once.
- **Individual Settle**: Dialog to record a partial or full payment for a specific pair.
