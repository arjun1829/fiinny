# Card Detail Screen

A comprehensive dashboard for managing a specific credit card.

## Overview

Provides deep visibility into a credit card's status, including cycle tracking, due dates, and payment history. It aims to prevent late fees by highlighting "Days to Due" and "Overdue" status.

## Features

- **Visual Progress**: Linear progress bar showing "Percent Paid" for the current cycle.
- **Cycle Management**: Lists past statements (cycles) with their status and due dates.
- **Payment Log**: detailed history of manual and automated payments.
- **Actions**:
    - **Mark Paid**: Manually close the current bill period.
    - **Add Payment**: Record a partial or full payment.
- **Alert Integration**: Updates `CardDueNotifier` when payments are made.

## Architecture

- **Tabbed View**: Overview, Statements, and Payments tabs.
- **Service Integration**: heavily reliant on `CreditCardService` for cycle calculations.
