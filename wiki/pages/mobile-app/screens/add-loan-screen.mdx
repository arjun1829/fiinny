# Add Loan Screen

A sophisticated, multi-step wizard for configuring a loan profile.

## Overview

Unlike simple forms, this screen includes a financial engine to compute EMI schedules and validate input.

## Steps

1.  **Basics**: Title, Lender (Bank/NBFC/Friend), and Current Outstanding.
2.  **Schedule**: Interest Rate, and EITHER "EMI Amount" OR "Months Remaining". It mathematically solves for the missing variable using `_solveMonthsReducing` or `_emiReducing`.
3.  **Share**: (Optional) Split this loan with others (e.g., a shared Home Loan).
4.  **Reminders**: Configure monthly due alerts.
5.  **Review**: Final validaiton and suggestions (e.g., "Rate is very high!").

## Features

- **Solver Engine**: Can calculate Tenure if EMI is known, or EMI if Tenure is known.
- **Recurring Engine**: Can `_shareCreateRecurringForMembers` to auto-link this loan to a friend's profile.
- **Restoration**: Uses `RestorationMixin` to save state if the app is killed by the OS.
