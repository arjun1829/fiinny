# Subscriptions Screen

A command center for recurring financial commitments.

## Overview

Helps users track subscriptions, bills, and free trials. The goal is to provide a "Total Monthly Burn" metric so users know exactly what their fixed costs are.

## Features

- **Total Monthly Burn**: Auto-normalizes different frequencies (yearly, weekly) into a monthly cost estimate.
- **Timeline Strip**: Horizontally adds a visual timeline of the next 5 upcoming payments.
- **Type Filtering**: Quick filters for "Subs", "Bills", and "Trials".
- **Visual Coding**: Color-coded indicators (Purple for Subs, Orange for Trials, Blue for Bills).

## Architecture

- **Stream Based**: Real-time updates from `SubscriptionService`.
- **Logic**: Client-side calculation for "Total Monthly Burn" and "Next Due" sorting.
