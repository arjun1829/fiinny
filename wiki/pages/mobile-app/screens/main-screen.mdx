# Main Screen (Legacy)

> [!WARNING]
> This screen appears to be deprecated or unused. The active main container is **[Main Nav Screen](./main-nav-screen.mdx)**.

## Overview

An alternative implementation of the main navigation shell. It uses a standard `BottomNavigationBar` without the custom "shine" animations found in `MainNavScreen`.

## Differences from MainNavScreen

- **Tabs**: Logic includes `Goals` and `Profile` directly in the tab bar, whereas `MainNavScreen` puts `Expenses` and `Sharing` in the tabs and usually nests Profile under settings.
- **State**: Simple `setState` index switching.

## Navigation Items
1.  Dashboard
2.  Friends
3.  Goals
4.  Profile
