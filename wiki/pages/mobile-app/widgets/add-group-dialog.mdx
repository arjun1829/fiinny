# Add Group Dialog

**Path:** `lib/widgets/add_group_dialog.dart`

Enables creation of a social expense group, including member selection, naming, and photo upload.

## Features
*   **Multi-Select Contacts:** Includes a built-in contact picker that supports selecting multiple people at once.
*   **Inline Friend Creation:** If a user selects a contact who isn't already a Fiinny friend, it creates a "placeholder" friend model on the fly.
*   **Group Metadata:** Supports setting a Group Type (Trip, Home, etc.) and an optional custom label/emoji.
*   **Photo Picker:** Allows setting a group avatar from the gallery or camera.

## Logic
*   It performs a check against existing friends (`_matchFriendByPhone`) to avoid duplicates when importing from contacts.
*   It persists metadata (type/label) to a sub-collection `groups/{groupId}/meta/info` immediately after creation.

## Usage

```dart
showDialog(
  context: context,
  builder: (_) => AddGroupDialog(
    userPhone: currentUser.phone,
    allFriends: myFriendsList,
    onGroupCreated: (groupId) {
      // Navigate to group details
    },
  ),
);
```
