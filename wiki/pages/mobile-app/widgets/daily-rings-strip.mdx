# Daily Rings Strip

**Path:** `lib/widgets/daily_rings_strip.dart`

A horizontal scrollable strip showing a "Day Summary" for the last 7+ days. Each item is a mini-visualization of that day's cash flow.

## Logic
*   **Value Object:** Uses `DaySummary` to hold `income`, `expense`, and `date`.
*   **Sorting:** Automatically sorts days to show the most recent first.
*   **Mini Rings:** Uses `_MiniDualPainter` to draw tiny, pixel-perfect versions of the main Hero Ring.
*   **Selection:** Highlights the currently selected day with ateal border/background.

## Usage

```dart
DailyRingsStrip(
  days: [
    DaySummary(date: DateTime.now(), income: 200, expense: 50),
    // ...
  ],
  selectedDate: _currentDate,
  onTap: (day) => _selectDate(day),
)
```
