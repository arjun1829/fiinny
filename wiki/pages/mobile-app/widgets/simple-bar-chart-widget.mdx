# Smart Bar Chart Widget

**Path:** `lib/widgets/simple_bar_chart_widget.dart`

**Note:** Despite the name "Simple", this is a complex "Smart" widget that handles its own state for filtering.

## Capabilities
1.  **Stateful Filtering:** Manages `_selectedCategory` and `_range` (Date Range) internally.
2.  **Date Picker:** Includes a custom date range picker interface and "Quick Range" chips (7 days, 30 days).
3.  **Dual Mode:**
    *   **Owe vs Owed:** If no `expenses` list is provided, it defaults to showing a simple 2-bar comparison of `owe` vs `owed`.
    *   **Expense Analysis:** If `expenses` ARE provided, it unlocks the filter UI and summary stats (count, total, average).

## Usage

```dart
SimpleBarChartWidget(
  owe: 500,
  owed: 1000,
  expenses: fullTransactionList, // Unlocks smart filters
  showFilters: true,
)
```
