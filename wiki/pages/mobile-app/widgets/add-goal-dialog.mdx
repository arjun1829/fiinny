# Add Goal Dialog

**Path:** `lib/widgets/add_goal_dialog.dart`

A visually rich dialog for setting financial goals. It employs a "glassmorphism" design and interactive elements to make goal setting feel positive and engaging.

## Features

*   **Emoji Picker:** A horizontally scrolling quick-picker for goal icons.
*   **Quick Amounts & Dates:** One-tap chips for common values (e.g., "+6 months", "₹50k").
*   **Smart Suggestions:** Calculates the required monthly savings in real-time based on the target date and amount (`_suggestion()`).
*   **Motivational Tips:** Cycles through financial wisdom quotes.
*   **Sub-goals:** Allows adding a checklist of dependencies or milestones.

## Visual Design
Uses `BackdropFilter` with `ImageFilter.blur` to create a frosted glass effect layered over the app background. Input fields use a custom "pill" decoration (`_pillDec`) consistent with the modern design language.

## Usage

```dart
showDialog(
  context: context,
  builder: (_) => AddGoalDialog(
    onAdd: (GoalModel newGoal) {
      // Persist to service
    },
  ),
);
```
