# Transaction Filter Bar

**Path:** `lib/widgets/filters/transaction_filter_bar.dart`

The master filter component for the transaction list. It is one of the most complex UI components in the app.

## Features
*   **Adaptive Layout:**
    *   **Portrait:** Shows a horizontal scrollable row of chips (Type, Period, Filter Btn, Sort).
    *   **Rail (Desktop/Tablet):** Shows a full vertical sidebar of expanded filter controls using the `_FilterControls` internal widget.
*   **Deep Filtering:** Supports filtering by:
    *   Date Range (Shortcuts + Custom)
    *   Amount Range (Min/Max)
    *   Category & Subcategory (Async loading)
    *   Merchant, Instrument, Bank, Tags, Labels, Groups, etc.
*   **Saved Views:** Users can save their current filter configuration as a named "View" (bookmark) for quick access later.
*   **Debouncing:** When used in Rail mode, applies filters with a 150ms debounce to prevent UI stuttering during rapid typing.

## Usage

```dart
TransactionFilterBar(
  allTx: rawTransactionMapList,
