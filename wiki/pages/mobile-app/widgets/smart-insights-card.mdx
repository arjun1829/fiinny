# Smart Insights Card

**Path:** `lib/widgets/smart_insights_card.dart`

A glass-morphic card that displays a single, high-priority insight based on the user's current context.

## Discovery Logic
It resolves the insight to display in the following priority order:
1.  **Preset Text:** If `insightText` is explicitly passed.
2.  **Net Worth:** If the user has significant assets/loans.
3.  **Spend vs Income:** Comparing total inflow vs outflow.
4.  **Savings Rate:** Highlighting saving habits.
5.  **Goal Pace:** If user is tracking a goal (e.g., "You have ₹20k left to reach Car").
6.  **Fallback:** Generic placeholder from `InsightMicrocopy`.

## Usage

```dart
SmartInsightCard(
  income: 50000,
  expense: 30000,
  savings: 20000,
  goal: myGoal,
  showToday: true,
)
```
