# Pie Chart (Glossy)

**Path:** `lib/widgets/charts/pie_chart_glossy.dart`

A visually rich radial chart that mimics a "glossy" 3D surface using custom shaders.

## Visual Effects
*   **Gloss Overlay:** Uses a `LinearGradient` shader masked to the pie shape to create a top-down light reflection.
*   **Sparkle:** Adds a `RadialGradient` highlight to simulate a specular highlight.
*   **Tinting:** Selected slices are dynamically lightened using HSL color manipulation.

## Interaction
*   **Custom Hit Testing:** Implements manual trigonometry (`atan2`) to detect which wedge was tapped, as standard `GestureDetector` doesn't support irregular shapes accurately without plugin overhead.

## Usage

```dart
PieChartGlossy(
  data: [
    DonutSlice("Food", 500),
    DonutSlice("Travel", 1200),
  ],
  size: 200,
  showCenter: true, // "Donut" hole
  onSliceTap: (index, slice) {},
)
```
