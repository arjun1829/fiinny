# People Selector

**Path:** `lib/widgets/people_selector_step.dart`

A shared step widget used within expense wizards (like `AddExpenseDialog`) to handle participant selection.

## Responsibilities
1.  **Payer Selection:** "Who paid?" (Me vs. Friend).
2.  **Group Selection:** Toggling between "No group" and specific user groups.
3.  **Split Participation:** Selecting which friends are involved in the expense.
4.  **Metadata:** Handling Note and Label entry.

## UI Components
*   **Rich Dropdowns:** Uses custom layouts in dropdowns to show avatars alongside names.
*   **Multi-Select Sheet:** If "See all..." is clicked, opens a full-screen checkbox list for selecting multiple friends.
*   **Input Chips:** Displays selected friends as removable chips for easy management.

## Usage
Designed to be embedded in a `PageView` or `Stepper`.

```dart
PeopleSelectorStep(
  userPhone: uid,
  // ... callbacks for state changes
  onPayer: (p) => setState(() => _payer = p),
  onToggleFriend: (phone, isSelected) => _updateSplits(phone, isSelected),
)
```
