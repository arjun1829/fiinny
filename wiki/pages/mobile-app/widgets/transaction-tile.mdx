# Transaction Tile

**Path:** `lib/widgets/transaction_tile.dart`

The fundamental atomic unit for displaying a transaction in a list. It is designed to be lightweight and stateless.

## Polymorphism
The tile accepts `dynamic transaction`, which can be either an `ExpenseItem` or `IncomeItem`. It internally switches:
*   **Income:** Green arrow, positive vibe.
*   **Expense:** Red arrow/pink accent.

## Features
*   **Three-Line Layout:** Supports `Title` (Category/Type), `Subtitle` (Note + Date), and `Trailing` (Actions).
*   **Inline Actions:** Exposes Edit, Delete, and Split buttons directly on the tile if callbacks are provided.

## Usage

```dart
ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (ctx, i) => TransactionTile(
    transaction: items[i],
    onEdit: () => edit(items[i]),
    onDelete: () => delete(items[i]),
  ),
);
```
