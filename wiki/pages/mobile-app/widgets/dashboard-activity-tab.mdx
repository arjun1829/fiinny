# Activity Tab

**Path:** `lib/widgets/dashboard_activity_tab.dart`

Displays a chronological feed of `ActivityEvent`s on the dashboard.

## Features
*   **Empty State:** Friendly message when no events exist.
*   **Card List:** Renders events as elevated cards with `ListTile`.
*   **Detail Sheet:** Tapping an event opens a modal bottom sheet with more specifics (currently a placeholder for future expansion).
*   **Date Formatting:** Uses `intl` to format timestamps (e.g., "12 Oct, 10:30 AM").

## Usage

```dart
DashboardActivityTab(
  events: myActivityList, // List<ActivityEvent>
)
```
