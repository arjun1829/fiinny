# Bar Chart (Simple)

**Path:** `lib/widgets/charts/bar_chart_simple.dart`

A scratch-built, highly generic bar chart widget optimized for aesthetics and performance.

## Features
*   **Custom Painting:** Uses `CustomPaint` for drawing the grid and background lines, ensuring crisp rendering.
*   **Animations:** Bars grow into place using `TweenAnimationBuilder`.
*   **Smart Scaling:** Includes a `_NiceScale` utility to calculate human-readable Y-axis ticks (e.g., 0, 50, 100 instead of 0, 47, 94).
*   **Interactive:** Supports tap callbacks on individual bars.
*   **Label Thinning:** Intelligent X-axis label skipping logic (`targetXTicks`) to prevent text overlap on dense datasets.

## Usage

```dart
BarChartSimple(
  data: [
    SeriesPoint(x: "Mon", y: 500),
    SeriesPoint(x: "Tue", y: 1200),
  ],
  height: 200,
  barColor: Colors.teal,
  onBarTap: (index, point) {
    print("Tapped ${point.x}");
  },
)
```
