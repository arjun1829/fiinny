# Note Sanitizer

**Path**: `lib/services/note_sanitizer.dart`

A text processing utility that cleans up raw SMS/Email bodies to create user-friendly "Notes" or "Previews".

## Logic
1.  **Cleaning**: Removes "junk" lines like "Not you?", "Download app", "Available Balance", OTPs, and long URLs.
2.  **Smart Summary**: If a `TxParseResult` is available, constructs a clean string like `"₹500 debited • Swiggy • Ref 1234"`.
3.  **Truncation**: Ensures the note fits within UI limits (240 chars).
4.  **Tagging**: Auto-generates tags like `UPI`, `P2M`, `CR` based on keywords.

## Usage
Used by `TxAnalyzer` and ingestion services to populate the `note` field of a transaction.
