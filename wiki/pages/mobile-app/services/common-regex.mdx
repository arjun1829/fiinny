**Path**: `lib/services/parse_engine/common_regex.dart`

The base library of Regular Expressions used across the app for parsing financial text.

## Capabilities

### Extraction
*   **Amounts**: Supports INR, USD, EUR, etc. Handles commas.
*   **Last 4**: "ending xx1234".
*   **UPI IDs**: Standard VPA patterns.
*   **Merchant Names**: Looks for "At", "To", "Paid to", or explicit headers.

### Classification
*   **Channel**: Determines if text refers to UPI, Card, NetBanking, ATM, etc.
*   **Direction**: Credit vs Debit keyword matching.

### Category Hints
*   **`categoryHint`**: A static heuristic engine that guesses category based on keywords (e.g., "swiggy" -> Food, "petrol" -> Fuel).
*   **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates a 0.0-1.0 score based on how many fields were successfully extracted.
