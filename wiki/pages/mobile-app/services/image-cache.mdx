# Image Cache

**Path**: `lib/services/image_cache.dart`

A utility to optimize image loading performance, specifically for brand logos.

## Responsibilities
*   **Pre-caching**: `warmUpBrands` loads a list of common assets (Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, etc.) into the memory cache on app startup.
*   **Cache Caps**: `setCaps` allows limiting the image cache size to prevent OOM errors on low-end devices.

## Usage
Called in `main.dart` or the Dashboard's `initState` to ensure smooth scrolling in transaction lists.
