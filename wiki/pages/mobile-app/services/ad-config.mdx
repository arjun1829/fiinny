# Ad Config

**Path**: `lib/services/ad_config.dart`

A simple configuration wrapper for Google Mobile Ads.

## Responsibilities
*   **Authorization Tracking**: Maintains a static `authorized` boolean based on user consent (ATT).
*   **Request Factory**: Provides a helper `AdRequest(nonPersonalizedAds: !authorized)` to ensure we request non-personalized ads if the user has denied tracking permissions.

## Usage
Used by ad widgets (`SleekAdCard`, `AdsBannerCard`) to configure their requests.
