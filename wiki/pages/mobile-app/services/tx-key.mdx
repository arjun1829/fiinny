# Transaction Key

**Path**: `lib/services/tx_key.dart`

A single helper function to generate **Stable Idempotency Keys** for transactions.

## Logic
`buildTxKey` combines:
*   **Bank Code**: e.g. "HDFC"
*   **Type**: "debit" / "credit"
*   **Pattern**: Last 4 digits (if available).
*   **Amount**: Normalized (2 decimal places).
*   **Time Bucket**: Rounds the timestamp to the nearest 5-minute bucket (default).

## Purpose
This prevents duplicate entries when the same transaction is received via multiple channels (e.g., SMS and Email) slightly apart in time. If they land in the same 5-minute bucket with the same details, they generate the same key.
