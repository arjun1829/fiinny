# Backup Service

**Path**: `lib/services/backup_service.dart`

The `BackupService` provides manual backup and restore functionality, primarily allowing users to export their data as a JSON file or save a snapshot to Firestore.

## Methods
*   **`backupUserData`**: Saves a snapshot of `incomes`, `expenses`, and `goals` to `users/{userId}/backups/latest`.
*   **`restoreUserData`**: Fetches the latest backup from Firestore.
*   **`shareUserData`**: Exports the backup as a JSON string and invokes the system share sheet (`share_plus`), allowing the user to email or save the file locally.
