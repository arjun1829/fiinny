# Firebase Insight Service (`firebase_insight_service.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/services/firebase_insight_service.dart`

## 1. Overview
The Persistence Layer for the "Smart Feed". It saves generated insights to Firestore so they persist across app restarts and devices.

## 2. Responsibilities
- **CRUD**: `saveInsight`, `fetchInsights` (ordered by timestamp).
- **Batch Generators**: Contains logic to generate specific alerts for **Credit Cards** and **Bills** (Due Soon / Overdue).
  - *Note:* This overlaps partially with `FiinnyBrainService`. Brain is the modern engine; this service's generation logic might be legacy or specific to the "Insights Tab" refresh loop.

## 3. Key Methods
- `generateAndSaveInsightsFromData`: Iterates through all cards and bills to create `InsightType.creditCardDue` or `billDue` alerts.

## 4. Usage
Used by `FiinnyBrainService` (to save its output) and background workers.
