# Income Service (`income_service.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/services/income_service.dart`

## 1. Overview
The **IncomeService** manages `IncomeItem` data. It mirrors the structure of `ExpenseService` but is simplified as incomes typically do not have complex "social splitting" logic (you rarely split a salary deposit with a friend).

## 2. Key Responsibilities
- **CRUD**: Full lifecycle management for income records.
- **Advanced Querying**: Supports `IncomeQuery` for filtering by date, category, source, and text search.
- **Analytics Support**: Provides `getIncomesInDateRange` for chart data generation.
- **Facets**: Extracts unique labels and categories for UI filtering.

## 3. Usage
Used by the **Income Tab** and **Analytics Screen** to retrieve inflow data.
