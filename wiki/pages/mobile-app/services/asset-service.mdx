# Asset Service (`asset_service.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/services/asset_service.dart`

## 1. Overview
A lightweight Service for managing `AssetModel` (Stocks, Gold, Real Estate).

## 2. Responsibilities
- **CRUD**: Basic Create, Read, Update, Delete for assets.
- **Aggregation**:
  - `getTotalAssets`: Returns the user's Total Net Worth (Asset side).
  - `getAssetBreakdown`: returns a Map of `AssetType -> TotalValue` for pie charts.
- **Fallback Sorting**: If Firestore indexes are missing (`failed-precondition`), it gracefully falls back to client-side sorting.

## 3. Usage
Used by the **Net Worth** card and **Assets Tab**.
