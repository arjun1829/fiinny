# Counterparty Extractor

**Path**: `lib/services/enrich/counterparty_extractor.dart`

Helper logic to identify *who* the transaction was with, distinct from the merchant.

## Logic
*   **Debit**: Looks for "paid to", "beneficiary", or VPA patterns.
*   **Credit**: Looks for "from", "by", or VPA patterns.
*   **Cleaning**: Removes noise words like "for", "the".
*   **Classification**: Guesses type (`person`, `merchant`, `bank`, `employer`) based on regex hints (e.g., VPA handle vs Bank acronyms).
