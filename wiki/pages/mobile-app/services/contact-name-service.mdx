# Contact Name Service (`contact_name_service.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/services/contact_name_service.dart`

## 1. Overview
Resolves **Phone Numbers** to **Device Contact Names** for privacy-friendly display.

## 2. Caching Strategy
- **Memory + Disk**: Caches names in `SharedPreferences` (`contactNames.cache.v1`) to avoid constant permission prompts or contact reads.
- **Normalization**: Uses E.164 normalization matching.

## 3. Best-Effort Lookup
`bestDisplayName` logic:
- Prefers **Device Name** if the remote name looks like a placeholder (e.g. "Member (123)").
- Prefers **Remote Name** if the user explicitly set a display name in their profile (and it's not a generic placeholder).
- Falls back to **Phone Number**.

## 4. Usage
Used extensively in **Friends List**, **Group Definitions**, and **Transaction Details** to show "Ramesh" instead of "+919876543210".
