# Credit Card Service (`credit_card_service.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/services/credit_card_service.dart`

## 1. Overview
Manages the lifecycle of Credit Cards, specifically **Cycles** and **Payments**.

## 2. Data Structure
- `users/{uid}/credit_cards/{cardId}`: Card definition.
- `.../cycles/{cycleId}`: Monthly statement cycles (Total Due, Paid Amount).
- `.../payments/{paymentId}`: Individual payments made towards the card.

## 3. Logic
- **Reconciliation (`recomputeCycleStatus`)**: Calculates `paidAmount` vs `totalDue` to determine if a cycle is `open`, `partial`, `paid`, or `overdue`.
- **Mark Paid**: Convenience method to create a manual payment entry equal to the remaining due amount.

## 4. Usage
Used by **Credit Card Detail Screen** and **Bill Payments**.
