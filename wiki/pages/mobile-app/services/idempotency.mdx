# Idempotency

**Path**: `lib/services/dedupe/idempotency.dart`

Contains the standard logic for generating **De-duplication Keys**.

## Algorithm
Generates a SHA-1 hash of:
`merchantId | amountPaise | instrumentHint | timeBucket`

*   **Time Bucket**: CURRENTLY 10 minutes (`occurredAt / 600000`). This fuzziness allows matching an SMS and an Email for the same transaction even if they arrive a few minutes apart.
