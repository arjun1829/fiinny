# Bill Service (`bill_service.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/services/bill_service.dart`

## 1. Overview
> [!WARNING]
> This service is currently a **Stub**. It contains `TODO`s and empty methods.

## 2. Status
- The methods `getUserBills`, `saveBill`, etc., return empty lists or `void`.
- **Implementation Note:** Actual "Bill" logic seems to be handled partly by `ExpenseService` (via `isBill` flag) or `SubscriptionService` in the current codebase state. Use those services instead.
