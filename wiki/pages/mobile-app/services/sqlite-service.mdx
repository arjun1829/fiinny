# SQLite Service

**Path**: `lib/services/sqlite_service.dart`

A local offline cache using `sqflite`.

## Responsibilities
*   **Tables**: `transactions` and `goals`.
*   **Usage**: Primarily used for **fast startup** (showing data before Firestore loads) or **offline support**. It currently mirrors `TransactionItem` and `GoalModel`.

(Note: The app's primary source of truth is Firestore; this is a secondary cache).
