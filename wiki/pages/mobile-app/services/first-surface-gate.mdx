# First Surface Gate

**Path**: `lib/services/push/first_surface_gate.dart`

A coordination primitive to prevent system permission dialogs (like iOS "Allow Notifications?") from showing up while the Flutter engine is still warming up or showing a splash screen.

## Mechanism
*   **`waitUntilReady()`**: A Future that waits until the app signals it's ready.
*   **`markReady()`**: Called by the main Dashboard or Home screen `initState`.
*   **Timeout**: Has a safe fallback (5s) so it doesn't block forever if the UI fails to mount.

This ensures a smoother UX and prevents "blank screen" issues during permission requests.
