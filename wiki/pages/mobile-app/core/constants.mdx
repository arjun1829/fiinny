# Constants (`constants.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/constants.dart`

## 1. Overview
A small utility file holding static constant values, primarily asset paths.

## 2. Why this file exists
To avoid typos in string paths (magic strings). Instead of typing `"assets/avatars/avatar1.png"` multiple times, we use `AppAssets.avatars[0]`.

## 3. Responsibilities
- Lists paths to images and other static resources.

## 4. How it works (high-level)
- Contains a class `AppAssets` with static properties.
- Includes the welcome background image and a list of user avatars.

## 5. Dependencies and Interactions
- Used by UI screens (like `OnboardingScreen` or `ProfileScreen`) to display images.

## 6. Cautions / Important Notes
> [!WARNING]
> Just adding a string here doesn't make the image work. You must also ensure the file exists in the `assets/` folder and is listed in `pubspec.yaml`.
