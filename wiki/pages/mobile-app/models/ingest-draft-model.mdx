# Ingest Draft (`ingest_draft_model.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/models/ingest_draft_model.dart`

## 1. Overview
The **gateway to the entire financial system**. Every incoming SMS, Email, or WhatsApp message first becomes an `IngestDraft`.

## 2. Responsibilities
- **Staging Area:** Acts as a temporary "draft" transaction that can be rejected or approved before entering the main `expenses`/`income` ledgers.
- **Traceability:** Keeps the original `sources` (SMS body, Email metadata) so we can always debug why a transaction was parsed a certain way.
- **Enrichment:** Holds raw `brain` data (AI tags) and `fxOriginal` (foreign currency info) waiting to be processed.

## 3. Key Logic
- `needsAmount`: A helper check. If true, the user must manually enter the amount (e.g., for ambiguous SMS alerts).

## 4. Usage
- **Collections:** `users/{uid}/ingest_drafts`.
- **UI:** The "Review Pending Transactions" card on the dashboard.
