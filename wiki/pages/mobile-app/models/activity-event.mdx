# Activity Event (`activity_event.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/models/activity_event.dart`

## 1. Overview
A specialized view model designed purely for the UI **Activity Feed**.

## 2. Responsibilities
- **Feed Item:** Represents a single row in the "Recent Activity" stream (e.g., "Arjun updated the Goa Trip").
- **Visuals:** Holds a pre-resolved `IconData` and formatted `subtitle` string ready for display.

## 3. Usage
- **UI:** The "Activity" sidebar or dashboard widget. It is **not** persisted to Firestore directly; it is logically derived from other real-time events.
