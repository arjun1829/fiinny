# Card Statement (`card_statement.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/models/card_statement.dart`

## 1. Overview
Represents a detailed **PDF Statement Parse Result**. When the System parses a PDF sent via email, it produces this object.

## 2. Responsibilities
- **Granular Breakdown:** Unlike `CreditCardCycle` (which is just a summary), this model can hold a breakdown of `components`: `newSpends`, `taxes`, `fees`.
- **Linking:** `id` is usually constructed as `stmt_<issuer>_<last4>_<yyyymm>` to create a deterministic key.

## 3. Usage
- **Pipeline:** PDF Parser -> `CardStatement` -> Firestore.
