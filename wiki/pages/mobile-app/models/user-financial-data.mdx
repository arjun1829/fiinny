# User Financial Data (`user_financial_data.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/models/user_financial_data.dart`

## 1. Overview
A **God Object** or "Aggregate Root" sometimes used to pass the entire user state in one go (e.g., for Export/Import or initial Dashboard loading).

## 2. Responsibilities
- **Container:** Holds lists of *everything*: `incomes`, `expenses`, `loans`, `assets`, `goals`, `bills`, etc.
- **Budgeting:** Stores `weeklyLimit` and current `weekStart` for budget calculations.

## 3. Key Logic
- `_getStartOfWeek()`: Auto-calculates the most recent Monday (or user-defined start) to anchor weekly graphs.

## 4. Usage
- **Services:** Often the return type of a `DataService.fetchAll()` call.
