# Transaction (`transaction.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/models/transaction.dart`

## 1. Overview
A specialized model representing a unified financial transaction. This appears to be a cleaner, stricter definition compared to older legacy models.

## 2. Responsibilities
- **Global Currency Support:** Explicitly handles `baseCurrency` vs `originalCurrency` and `fxRate`.
- **Source Tracing:** Tracks `sourceChannels` (where the tx came from).
- **Instrument Details:** Stores `instrumentType` (CC, UPI) and `instrumentId`.

## 3. Key Logic
- `isForeignTransaction`: Boolean getter that checks if `baseCurrency != originalCurrency`.
- **Immutability:** All fields are `final` and uses `copyWith` for modifications, ensuring thread-safety and predictable state updates.

## 4. Dependencies
- Imports `raw_transaction_event.dart` (likely for `TransactionSourceChannel`).

## 5. Usage
This model is likely used in newer parts of the app that require robust multi-currency or multi-channel support, distinct from the simpler `TransactionItem`.
