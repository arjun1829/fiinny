# User Model (`user_model.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/models/user_model.dart`

## 1. Overview
Represents the core profile of a registered user in Fiinny.

## 2. Responsibilities
- Stores essential user identity information (Name, Email, Phone).
- Holds localization preferences (Country, Currency).
- Manages the user's avatar.

## 3. Key Fields
| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `phone` | `String` | **Foreign Key / ID**. The E.164 formatted phone number (e.g., `+919876543210`). Used as the primary identifier in many other services. |
| `currency` | `String` | The user's preferred currency code (e.g., `INR`, `USD`). |
| `avatar` | `String` | Path to the avatar asset or URL. |

## 4. Usage
- Used by `ProfileScreen` to display user details.
- Used during `Onboarding` to create the initial user account.
- `fromMap` handles defensive parsing to safely load legacy data where some fields might be missing.

## 5. Cautions
> [!NOTE]
> The `phone` field is often used as the unique ID for fetching data across the app (unlike Firebase UID in some other places). Ensure it is always present and correctly formatted.
