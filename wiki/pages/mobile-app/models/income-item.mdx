# Income Item (`income_item.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/models/income_item.dart`

## 1. Overview
The counterpart to `ExpenseItem`, representing money flowing **into** the user's account (Salary, Refunds, Credits).

## 2. Responsibilities
- **Income Data:** Amount, Source ("Email", "SMS"), Type.
- **Context:** `counterparty` (e.g., Employer Name), `instrument` (NEFT, IMPS), and `bankLogo`.
- **Attachments:** Supports proofs of income/refunds.
- **Audit:** Tracks who created/updated the record (`parser:gmail` vs `user`).

## 3. Key Differences from Expense
- Lacks "Splitting" logic (Income is usually personal).
- Has `source` field explicitly defined ("Email" | "SMS" | "Manual").

## 4. Usage
- **Firestore:** corresponds to `income` collection.
- **UI:** Used in `IncomeScreen` (if it exists) or mixed into `UnifiedTransactionList`.

## 5. Cautions
- Similar to `ExpenseItem`, `note` is system-generated. Do not overwrite it with user comments; use `comments` instead.
