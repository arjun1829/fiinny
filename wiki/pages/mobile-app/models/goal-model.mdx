# Goal Model (`goal_model.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/models/goal_model.dart`

## 1. Overview
Represents a financial goal (e.g., "Buy a Car", "Emergency Fund").

## 2. Responsibilities
- **Targeting:** `targetAmount` and `targetDate`.
- **Progress:** `savedAmount` and calculated `progress` (0.0 to 1.0).
- **Status:** Tracks if a goal is `active`, `completed`, or `paused`.

## 3. Key Logic
- `requiredPerMonth`: A helpful getter that tells the user "You need to save ₹5,000/month" to hit their target on time.
- `daysRemaining`: Countdown helper.

## 4. Usage
- **Collections:** `goals` collection.
- **UI:** `GoalsScreen` dashboard.
