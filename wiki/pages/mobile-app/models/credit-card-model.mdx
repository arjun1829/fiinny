# Credit Card Model (`credit_card_model.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/models/credit_card_model.dart`

## 1. Overview
Represents a user's credit card. It tracks the card's identity (Bank, Last 4) and its current billing status (Total Due, Due Date).

## 2. Responsibilities
- **Card Identity:** Stores `bankName`, `cardType`, and `last4Digits` to display the card in the UI ("HDFC Regalia ending in 1234").
- **Bill Snapshot:** Holds the *latest* billing info (`totalDue`, `minDue`, `dueDate`) directly on the card object for quick access.
- **PDF Security:** Stores a `PdfPassFormat` hint (e.g., `first4name_ddmm`) to help the specialized PDF parser unlock statements automatically. It **does not** store the actual password.

## 3. Key Logic
- `isOverdue`: Computed property checking if today > `dueDate` and `!isPaid`.
- `daysToDue()`: Helper to show "Due in 5 days" countdowns.

## 4. Usage
- **Collections:** Stored in the `credit_cards` collection in Firestore.
- **UI:** Used in `CreditCardScreen` and the "Cards" section of the dashboard.

## 5. Cautions
> [!WARNING]
> Do NOT store full card numbers or CVV. This model is designed only for expense tracking and bill reminders, not for processing payments.
