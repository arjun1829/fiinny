# Suggested Classification (`suggested_classification.dart`)

**Path:** `lib/models/suggested_classification.dart`

## 1. Overview
A portable data structure carrying **AI predictions**. It can be attached to any transaction or draft.

## 2. Responsibilities
- **Predictions:** `category`, `subcategory`, and `merchant` names suggested by the model.
- **Metadata:** `confidence` (0.0 to 1.0), `latencyMs` (performance tracking), and `by` (model version, e.g., "gpt-4-turbo").

## 3. Key Logic
- **Flexible Deserialization:** `fromMap` handles both flat structures (fields directly on the parent doc) and nested structures (under an `aiSuggestion` key), making it robust for schema evolution.

## 4. Usage
- **UI:** Used to show "Suggested Category" pills that users can tap to confirm or reject.
